## 10. Connecting to a Database

IBM Cloud has a catalog of services available to handle many of the needs of an enterprise. One of the most common requirements of enterprises is the longterm persistence of business valuable information in a database. In this section we will walk through connecting our serverless functionss to a Cloudant instance. Cloudant is a NoSQL datastore, based on [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/).

### Viewing Pre-Registered Packages

1. OpenWhisk on IBM Cloud comes with several pre-installed packages. These packages can help when interacting with common services like; messaging, IBM Watson, and datastores. You can view these packages by running the following command:
	
	```
	ibmcloud fn package list /whisk.system
	```

	This command returns all the packages registered under the system package `/whisk.system`. In the output you should see: `/whisk.system/websocket`, `/whisk.system/messaging`, `/whisk.system/github`, etc.. 

2. The package we are interested in is `/whisk.system/cloudant`. Pre-installed packages come with actions, feeds, and other useful bits for interacting with a service. You can get a condensed summary of everything within a package with this command:

	```
	ibmcloud fn package get --summary /whisk.system/cloudant
	```

	You will get a response back that looks something like this:

	```
	package /whisk.system/cloudant: Cloudant database service
	   (parameters: *apihost, *bluemixServiceName, dbname, host, iamApiKey, iamUrl, overwrite, password, username)
	 action /whisk.system/cloudant/delete-attachment: Delete document attachment from database
	   (parameters: attachmentname, dbname, docid, docrev, params)
	 action /whisk.system/cloudant/update-attachment: Update document attachment in database
	   (parameters: attachment, attachmentname, contenttype, dbname, docid, docrev, params)
	 action /whisk.system/cloudant/read-attachment: Read document attachment from database
	   (parameters: attachmentname, dbname, docid, params)
	 action /whisk.system/cloudant/create-attachment: Create document attachment in database
	   (parameters: attachment, attachmentname, contenttype, dbname, docid, docrev, params)
	 action /whisk.system/cloudant/read-changes-feed: Read Cloudant database changes feed (non-continuous)
	   (parameters: dbname, params)
	 action /whisk.system/cloudant/delete-query-index: Delete index from design document
	   (parameters: dbname, docid, indexname, params)
	 action /whisk.system/cloudant/delete-view: Delete view from design document
	   (parameters: dbname, docid, params, viewname)
	 action /whisk.system/cloudant/manage-bulk-documents: Create, Update, and Delete documents in bulk
	   (parameters: dbname, docs, params)
	...
	```

	The `/whisk.system/cloudant` package contains many common database operations; `update`, `read`, `create`, and so on. A key concept within serverless is offloading work on to the platform. Here, instead of adding logic to the functions we are writing to handle database behavior, we will instead use these pre-existing functions. 

---
**Tip**: If you want a more detailed view of a package you can also run `ibmcloud fn package get [PACKAGE_NAME]` like here:

```
ibmcloud fn package get /whisk.system/cloudant
```

---

### Binding to a Cloudant Instance

Let's create and bind a Cloudant instance to a package so we can start persisting data. 

#### Copying a Package

First we must make a copy of the `/whisk.system/cloudant` package. This isn't strictly necessary for this workshop, but if we were to bind a Cloudant instance to `/whisk.system/cloudant`, then everyone would be writing to the same Cloudant instance which might not be what you want! 

1. To create a copy of a package run the following command: 

	```
	ibmcloud fn package bind /whisk.system/cloudant go-serverless-cloudant
	```

2. This will create a new package `/go-serverless-cloudant`. To view the newly created package run this command: 

	```
	ibmcloud fn package list
	```

#### Creating a Cloudant Service Instance

Next we need to create our Cloudant instance. This can be done through the IBM Cloud CLI.

1. First, make sure you're linked to your default resource group by executing:

	```
	ibmcloud target -g Default
	```

	This is necessary because our database will be created as resource in IBM Cloud, and resources are linked to a resource group.

2. When creating our new Cloudant instance, be sure to replace `MY_REGION` in the command below with the [current region](region-list.md) you are working in:
	
	```
	ibmcloud resource service-instance-create cloudant-serverless cloudantnosqldb lite MY_REGION -p '{"legacyCredentials": false}' 
	```

	This will create a Cloudant instance with the name `cloudant-serverless`.

3. Next, we need to create service credentials so we can connect to this datastore. To do that, run the following command: 

	```
	ibmcloud resource service-key-create creds_cloudantserverless Manager --instance-name cloudant-serverless
	```

	The key `creds_cloudantserverless` gives Manager rights to the service instance `cloudant-serverless`.

#### Configuring the Package to Talk to a Database
	
The package, we created earlier from `/whisk.system/cloudant`, contains the `write` action. It looks something like this:  

```
 action go-serverless-cloudant/write: Write document in database
   (parameters: dbname, doc)
```
	
The action has two parameters, `dbname` and `doc`. The former will be the string value of the database, that will be created later in this section. The second parameter needs to be in the form of a JSON message. We will go into more detail on that later. 

For `dbname` we can configure a package to pass in default parameters to actions contained within a package. Default parameters can be manually overwritten, but are otherwise passed into every action invocation with in the package they are set. 

1. In a moment we will be creating a database called `fibonaccidb`, but first lets update the package to pass that value in as a default parameter.

	```
	ibmcloud fn package update go-serverless-cloudant -p dbname fibonaccidb
	```

2. Next let's update the `go-serverless-cloudant` with the credentials we created in the previous section

	```
	ibmcloud fn service bind cloudantnosqldb go-serverless-cloudant --instance cloudant-serverless --keyname creds_cloudantserverless
	```

#### Create a New Database

1. Now that we've bound the package `go-serverless-cloudant` to our Cloudant instance, we can invoke the `create-database` action to create the database where we will be persisting our data to. For this, run the following command: 

	```
	ibmcloud fn action invoke --result go-serverless-cloudant/create-database -p dbname "fibonaccidb"
	```
	
	This command creates the database `fibonaccidb` and should return output similar to:

	```json
	{
       "ok": true
	}
	```

### Persisting to Cloudant

With our Cloudant instance created and configured, let's start persisting data to it. 
	
#### Configuring a Sequence to Write to a Database

1. The action `calculateRatio` is currently returning the value of `ratio`. To store this in Cloudant we will need to wrap this in an object call `doc`. This could be done directly in `calculateRatio`, but we want our functions to be atomic in their behavior. So instead let's create a new function called `buildCloudantDoc`. 

	For this, go to the [toolchain](https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/toolchains) and open the **Orion Web IDE** and create a new Java file called `BuildCloudantDoc.java`. Copy the following code into it: 

	```java
	package com.example;
	
	import com.google.gson.JsonObject;
	
	public class BuildCloudantDoc {
	
		   public static JsonObject main (JsonObject args) {
		      JsonObject response = new JsonObject();
		      response.add("doc", args);
		      return response;
		   }  
	}
	```

	---
	**Tip:** We will be making several updates to `manifest.yml`. To see an expanded view of what the file should look like, and where all the elements go, look at the end of this section.
	
	---
	
2. Next, update the `manifest.yml` file to declare this new action:

	```yaml
	      cloudantDocBuilder:
	        function: hello-world-java.jar
	        runtime: java
	        main: com.example.BuildCloudantDoc 
	```

3. Finally, update the `ratio` sequence by adding the `cloudantDocBuilder` and `go-serverless-cloudant/write` actions:

	```yaml
	     ratio:
	        actions: fibonacciNumber, calculateRatio, cloudantDocBuilder, go-serverless-cloudant/write
	```

4. Commit and push these changes via the Web IDE to trigger the deployment pipeline. Check the [Working with Sequences](STEP8.md) section of this workshop if you're not sure anymore how to do this.

#### Testing the Updated Sequence

1. Everything should now be in place to test the updated `ratio` sequence. The sequence will persist the calculated ratio to the database. For this, run the following command:

	```
	ibmcloud fn action invoke --result golden-ratio/ratio -p number 4
	```

	which returns a JSON message similar to

	```json
	{
       "id": "03833e0253a495558a456c9c49f4367c",
       "ok": true,
       "rev": "1-681f2175bf5f993643f6d4e95a96a1e9"
	}
	```
	
	Take a note of the `id` in the return JSON message as we will need this document id in the next step.
	
2. To read the newly stored value from the datanase, replace `DOCID` in the command below with the document id from the previous step and execute it.
	
	```
	ibmcloud fn action invoke --result  go-serverless-cloudant/read -p dbname fibonaccidb -p id DOCID
	```
	
	You should see a reponse that looks similar to this:
	
	```json
	{
      "_id": "03833e0253a495558a456c9c49f4367c",
      "_rev": "1-681f2175bf5f993643f6d4e95a96a1e9",
      "ratio": 1.5
    }
	```
