## 11. Creating a Rule

OpenWhisk supports the concept of rules. Rules are the combination of a trigger and an action to invoke when that trigger condition is met. Rules are a central concept when developing a serverless architecture by allowing actions andd sequences to be executed automatically. In this section we will look at how to create a trigger and combine it together with an action to create a rule. 

### Defining a Trigger

Triggers allow for the creation of an event-driven architecture. Openwhisk is very flexible in how a triggering condition can be defined, it could be some external like time of day, or responding to changes in system state like a message being published to a queue, or as we will look at in this section a record being written to our Cloudant database. 

1. In the previous section we created the `go-serverless-cloudant`, within that package there is the feed `changes`:

	```
	 feed   /[YOURACCOUNTNAME]_dev/go-serverless-cloudant/changes: Database change feed
   (parameters: dbname, filter, iamApiKey, iamUrl, query_params)
   ```
	
	The `changes` feed takes several parameters. `dbname` is already being supplied by the default parameter we setup in the previous step, along with `iamApiKey`, `iamUrl` which are supplied by the credntials we provided. `filter` and `query_params` can be supplied to provide more fine grained control over what events are pulled from the feed. Additionally feeds take a `lifecycleEvent` parameter, which has six values `CREATE`, `READ`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `PAUSE`, or `UNPAUSE`. We will use the `CREATE` lifecycle. 

2. Update the `manifest.yml` with the following, `triggers` will be at the same identation level as `actions`:
  
  ```yaml
  triggers:
    fibonacciAdd: #Name of trrigger
      feed: /[YOURACCOUNTNAME]_dev/go-serverless-cloudant/changes #fully qualified name of feed
      inputs: 
        dbname: fibonaccidb
        lifecycleEvent: CREATE #Lifecycle event to check for
  ```

### Defining a Rule

Rules are a combination of a trigger and an action to run. We defined the trigger, now we need to create an action to be executed with the trigger is tripped. 

1. Go to the [toolchain](https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/toolchains) and open the **Orion Web IDE** to create a new Java file called `ReadCloudantDoc.java` under the `com/example` package. we will simply read the raw value that was added to the database and write it to the log. Copy the following code into it:  

	```java
	package com.example;
	
	import java.util.logging.Logger;
	import com.google.gson.JsonObject;
	
	public class ReadCloudantDoc {
		   protected static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("basic");
	
		   public static JsonObject main (JsonObject args) {
		      System.out.println("Newly written value: " + args.toString());
		      JsonObject response = new JsonObject();
		      response.addProperty("success", true);
		      return response;
		   }  
	}
	```

2. Create the new action  `readCloudantDoc` under `golden-ratio` that executes the Java class we just created:

	```yaml
      readCloudantDoc:
        function: hello-world-java.jar
        runtime: java
        main: com.example.ReadCloudantDoc
	```

3. Finally we will define the rule with the following yaml. `rules` should also be at the same identation level as `actions`: 

	```yaml
   rules:
      readFibonacciRatios:
        trigger: fibonacciAdd
        action: readCloudantDoc
	```
	
4. [Commit and Sync Changes with your GitLab Repo](GIT.md)

### Testing the Rule 

5. Once the build process has completed execute again the ratio sequence:

	```
	ibmcloud fn action invoke --result golden-ratio/ratio -p number 4
	```
6. Next view all the recent action executions with the following:

	```
	ibmcloud fn activation list --limit 6
	```
	
	The first item in the output should look something like this this: 
	
	```
  Datetime            Activation ID                    Kind      Start Duration   Status  Entity

	```
	
	Copy the `Activation ID` from the first row in your output. 
	
7. To view the log statement we wrote with the `readCloudantDoc` action run this command:

	```
	ibmcloud fn activation logs RETURNED_ID
	```
	
	You should get a return that looks something like this:
	
	```
