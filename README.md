# Go Serverless with Java

Serverless functions are an emerging technology for decomposing business operations into very fine grain chunks of code. Functions provide advantages to organization by increasing agility and cost savings by allowing "scale to zero" when a function is no longer being actively used.

In this workshop we will look at how to write Serverless Functions in Java and run them on [Apache Openwhisk](https://openwhisk.apache.org/) hosted on IBM Cloud.
